# Attendence Program

## Main Idea
This program will make taking attendence easier. 
It will then store all the information.
You can then run raffles off of the information.

## Program Location
The attendence program is located at  https://daniel-farkas-dev.github.io/sandbox/index.html.

## Uses
* in class attendence
* after school programs

## Devices
The attendence program will work any any device thanks to Bootstrap.
As long as the device is connected to internet the program will work.

## Permissions
This program has an MIT lisence.
Please do not sell this program without it.
